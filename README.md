# Object-Oriented Programming Course (TypeScript)

<br>

This repository contains all the exercise solutions from the ***["OOP Course (Java) - Gustavo Guanabara"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHz_AreHm4dkqe2aR0tQK74m8SFe-aGsY&feature=shared)*** using the ***TypeScript*** programming language. However, this content doesn't limit itself only to Java learners or programmers. The concepts exemplified here are present in all object-oriented programming languages, such as PHP, Python, C#, C++, Ruby, Swift, and so on. Therefore, you can use this material as a base to strengthen your knowledge in topics like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in several languages.

<br>

To help you even more, I wrote a documentation explaining each OOP concept and how to implement all the codes. To access this documentation, click ***[here](https://alanbmrosa.notion.site/Curso-de-Programa-o-Orientada-a-Objetos-Java-29441cbf30404a2ea9cb4a05d419d695?pvs=4)***.

<br>

So, I hope you enjoy and learn a lot from this material. This will show you how programming using object orientation is easy and simple, as well as help you develop great applications using the best practices and standards on the market. Good studies! ðŸ˜‰
